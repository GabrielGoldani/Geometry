# GeometryCatcher

This is a 2d game made during a course I subscribed to from DankiCode.

GeometryCatcher was reproduced with the intention of learning and introducing the unreal engine, totally basic with mechanics of moving left and right with the mouse to capture geometric objects in a given time.

If you're interested in checking, you can download the project and run the executable, it's already packed
